# 42 - Libft

## About
Libft is the first project from the 42-cursus curriculum. It is an excerice to recreate basic functions in C programming language.
All functions and .c files are compiled with the Makefile to create a libft.a library. This library is used in later projects of the curriculum.
Testing code for the functions is included as well and must be compiled separately with the created library. The testing code is something I just did on the side,
it should not serve as an indicator to pass the Moulinette check! It doesn't take into account all the edge cases.

- This repository is mostly just an archive of my studies, and can serve as a reference for future students in a time of need. However, I strongly encourage students to avoid just copy-pasting.
